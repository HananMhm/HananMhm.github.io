####  Benefits of data-centric AI
Some of the world’s largest organizations have benefited from adopting data-centric AI. Using Snorkel Flow, a data-centric AI application development platform, companies from diverse industries such as banks, biotech, insurance providers, telecommunications, government agencies, and more have seen improvements in developing and deploying deep-learning-based solutions. A few improvements we’ve seen from the adoption of a data-centric approach include:
01
Faster development: A Fortune 50 bank built a news analytics application 45x faster and with +25% higher accuracy than a previous system.
02
Higher accuracy: A global telco improved the quality of over 200,000 labels for network classification resulting in a 25% improvement in accuracy over the ground truth baseline.
03
Cost savings: A large biotech firm saved an estimated $10 million on unstructured data extraction, achieving 99% accuracy using Snorkel Flow
